I am really pleased to announce that I have decided to try my hand at talking
at conferences again this year and have a new talk ready "Stealthier Attacks
and Smarter Defending with TLS Fingerprinting".  Despite being a talk on TLS
(and SSL) there isn't any complex crypto or mathematics, this is aimed at
defenders and attackers rather than cryptographers.  Here's the abstract:<br />

> Ever been busted because you man in the middle software (which does TLS
> properly) alerted someone to your bad certificate?  No more! Want to detect
> certain types of connections leaving your network, but can't keep the IP
> blacklist up to date?  This could be the answer.

> This talk includes an introduction to both TLS and man in the middle attacks,
> a walkthrough on what TLS fingerprints contain, how to create your own
> fingerprints, how we use the fingerprints in several scenarios, a demo, and a
> discussion of implications and pitfalls.

> TLS provides transport security to all manner of connections from legitimate
> financial transactions to private conversations and malware calling home.
> The inability to analyse encrypted traffic protects its users, whether they
> are legitimate or malicious.  This talk explores a technique for quickly and
> passively fingerprinting TLS clients and adapting our responses for the
> purposes of both attack and defence. Attackers can make automated decisions
> concerning when to man in the middle a connection and when to let the clients
> pass through silently, remaining stealthy.  Defenders can gain insight into
> what is making encrypted connections within their networks without access to
> either endpoints or cryptographic keying material.

I am really excited to have been accepted to speak at <a href="http://www.sector.ca/">SecTor</a> for the second time in October (page for my session <a href="http://www.sector.ca/Program/Sessions/Session-Details/stealthier-attacks-and-smarter-defending-with-tls-fingerprinting">here</a>).
