Returning for it's third year, <a href="http://www.bsidesto.ca/">BSides
Toronto</a> has just been announced for 7th November 2015 and the CFP opened,
so if you want to speak get your submission in!  (details on <a
href="http://www.bsidesto.ca/">the BSidesTO website</a>).<br />

Keep an eye out on <a href="http://twitter.com/bsidesto/">Twitter</a> too as
announcements when registration opens, speakers are announced, etc.<br />

I won't be speaking this year because I have the pleasure of taking one of the
spots as an organiser for the conference, so I will definitely be there...
lurking :)
