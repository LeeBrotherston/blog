Today I gave my talk at [DerbyCon][1], "Stealthier Attacks & Smarter Defending with TLS Fingerprinting".  The links to all the resources are:

* [Paper / Post][2] giving a technical overview of the fingerprinting technique discussed.
* [Slides][3] from the talk, which probably don't make much sense without the talk.
* [Tools][4] discussed during the talk

Don't forget to join in the conversation on twitter too either to [my account][5] or the [FingerprinTLS][6] account.
