I haven't posted for a while, largely because I have been working on some research that I have been doing, and am  presenting at both [SecTor][1] in a few weeks, and [DerbyCon][2] tomorrow.  I will be releasing some materials relating to this talk so that people who are not in attendance can obtain the information without having to listen to me on a recording, so if you are interested in TLS Fingerprinting, keep an eye out tomorrow as I will be publishing a longer than normal post with some of the technical details and tools.

As usual, I'm always eager to hear any feedback on my own [twitter account][3] or via the [FingerprinTLS][4] account.
