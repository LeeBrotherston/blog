I have unbroken my blog, so in preparation for BlackHat Arsenal I have [written up a few use cases for FingerPrinTLS][1].  The specific examples I have given are:

* Supplementing IDS
* Malware hunting and enhancing ThreatIntel(sorry!) Feeds
* Protecting API endpoints and Web Servers
* Canaries for Unicorns

Enjoy!
