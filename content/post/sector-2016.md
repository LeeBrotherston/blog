A week ago I gave my talk "[Ab]Using TLS for Defensive Wins" at <a href="http://sector.ca">SecTor 2016</a>.  Here is my little blurb:

> TLS, and itâ€™s older forerunner SSL, are used to maintain the confidentiality
> and integrity of network communications. This is a double edged sword for
> Information Security departments as this allows private information to remain
> private, but can also be used to hide malicious activity.
> 
> Current defensive measures for dealing with network traffic encrypted using TLS
> typically takes one of two forms; attempting to detect malicious activities via
> other means which are outside of the encrypted session, such as endpoint
> security tools and IP address blacklists. The other approach is to break the
> TLS trust model by effectively attacking all connections, including trusted
> connections, via MiTM with a trusted certificate.
> 
> This talk discusses the problems with the current state of the art and
> introduces other techniques, such as TLS Fingerprinting and TLS Handshake
> Mangling, which can be used to solve the same problems with less of the issues.
