With all the talk of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/02/19/superfish_lenovo_spyware/">Lenovo</a> and <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2015/02/lenovo-pcs-ship-with-man-in-the-middle-adware-that-breaks-https-connections/">Superfish</a> in the press, now seems a good time to mention an update which is personal to me on the topic of Man in The Middle attacks.

People have asked me how widespread the <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">man in the middle attempts made my by ISP</a> actually are.  Well thankfully the manufacturer of the equipment used has put out a press statement around their current "subscriber reach" which you can read in full <a href="http://www.perftech.com/newsroom/perftech-adds-telco-giant-roster-q4-grows-subscriber-reach-30-2014/">here</a>.  The important paragraph for us is this:

> New-customer wins along with existing-customer expansions for 2014 resulted in a substantial increase in the aggregate subscriber reach across all PerfTechâ€™s ISP customers.  Previously at roughly 15 million subscribers, that total climbed to approximately 19.5 million for 2014, a gain of 30%.

If these figures are to be believed, that's 19.5 million subscribers.  By my understanding a subscriber is a connection (e.g. one cable or DSL line), not a single device so the total user count is probably significantly higher.
