I realise that I have not posted for a while, so I just wanted to drop a quick mini-post'ette to say that I have been working hard on a number of things to do with my <a href="/tls-fingerprinting/">TLS Fingerprinting</a> side project.  If you keep track of my <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/tls-fingerprinting/">GitHub page</a> you'll probably see the fruits of my labour first.<br />
<br />
I'm planning on creating a number of posts on using the <a href="https://github.com/LeeBrotherston/tls-fingerprinting/tree/master/fingerprintls">FingerPrinTLS tool</a> once I have a few more key items in.  Since I spoke at DerbyCon and SecTorCA I have introduced a number of new features, including:

* 802.1Q support
* IPv6 support
* Privilege dropping
* Timestamps to output
* Dynamically generate new signatures from unknown connections
* Binary fingerprint "database" file as opposed to compiled in fingerprints
* Cleanups (but more is needed)
* Database search optimisations


I'm currently working on a few other things (threading, code cleanup, optimisations, etc) then I'll drop some more real-world-useful tutorials.
