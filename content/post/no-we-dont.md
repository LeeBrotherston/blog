I just got a festive present from my ISP, <a href="http://www.rogers.com">Rogers</a>.<br /><br />

Following my <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/10/29/corporation-in-the-middle/">recent <a href="http://blog.squarelemon.com/blog/2014/12/24/bsides-toronto-video-and-slides/">talks</a> regarding ISP packet injection/interception and data collection I wrote to the privacy officer at Rogers and asked, under PIPEDA, that I be supplied all information regarding my account, including any information that they have gathered such as URLs of sites visited, etc.<br />
<br />
I got a fairly standard response which said that they did not collect any such data, to which I replied:<!-- More -->
<br />

I don't feel that this is going to progress anytime soon.
